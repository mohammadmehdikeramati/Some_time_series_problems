# Some_time_series_problems
In this repository, I am gonaa to work on some data stes, which are available online (their links will be attached) with time series features.  
## First problem: invertigating effect of changing hyperparameters on temperature predication problem
In this problem I tried to investigate the effect of changing hyperparameters such as numbers of units, drop out and learning rate value, optimizer, time steps and also adding some dense layer instead of one layer in out put.
### First: changing numbers of units
As the results show
